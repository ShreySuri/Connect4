# Connect4
Connect4 is a board game involving plastic chips and a chip holder. One wins the game by dropping the chips in a certain fashion, specifically by getting 4 in a row. When one player gets 4 chips in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, they win the game. 

AI as Player 2 may be to follow, but for the time being this will be two-player.

Connect4 is a board game involving plastic chips and a chip holder. One wins the game by dropping the chips in a certain fashion, specifically by getting 4 in a row. When one player gets 4 chips in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, they win the game. 

Connect4 is a two-player connection board game. Players choose a color and take turns dropping colored tokes into a grid. 

 -- The grid has 6 rows and 7 columns
 -- Tokens fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column
 
 The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line out of one's own tokens.
